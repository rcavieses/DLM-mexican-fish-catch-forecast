# Gulf of California Fisheries Forecasting
This repository hosts a suite of Python codes aimed at addressing the critical challenges faced by the Small-Scale fisheries in the Gulf of California, a pivotal region for Mexico's fisheries production and biodiversity. Amidst the backdrop of climate change, these tools leverage Deep Learning techniques to forecast fish catch volumes, contributing to sustainable resource management and informed decision-making.

## Background
The Gulf of California, a key ecosystem with significant contributions to Mexico's fisheries output, is experiencing shifts due to climate change, impacting fish distribution, species targeted, and overall catch volumes. This project aims to utilize Artificial Intelligence to understand and predict changes in catch volumes under varying climate scenarios, focusing on the multi-species small-scale fisheries in the region.

## Project Aim
The goal is to employ deep learning models to explore the complex dynamics between oceanic conditions and catch volumes, thereby aiding in the sustainable management of fisheries in the Northern Gulf of California. This involves analyzing the intricate relationships and predicting future catch volumes amidst evolving climate patterns.
